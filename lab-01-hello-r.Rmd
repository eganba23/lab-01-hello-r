## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

1846 rows
 2 columns (assume x and y)
 variables are: away, bullseye, circle, dino, dots, h_lines, high_lines, slant_down, slant_up, star, v_lines, wide_lines, x_shape

### Exercise 2

Code to create:

```{r plot-dino, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Code to calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-dino}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

Observations:
  | Data pulled from dinosaur dataset
  | ggplot function is being used to graph each datapoint from datasaurus_dozen/dino_data
  | data must be have x and y
  | almost 0 coorelation, makes sense
  


### Exercise 3

This is your turn to write the code and narrative for the star dataset. Follow the same steps as above to complete the analysis. Don't forget to label your chunks appropriately!

Note that the R chunks are labeled with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient.
To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.

Graph of star data

```{r plot-star, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")
ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
  
  
```

correlation for star data

```{r cor-star}

star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))

```

Observations:
  | star had lots of datapoints around the points but not on the straight parts of the stars


### Exercise 4


Code for circle data

```{r plot-circle, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")
ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note there's a couple random plot points that are off


```{r cor-circle}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

### Exercise 5

Plots for all datasets

```{r plot-all}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Correlations for all datasets - not currently doing what it's supposed to do

``` {r cor-all}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
